This chapter is going to take me through the real rust programming language constructs.
What this language is actually made of and the things that make it different and special.
I am eager to know you rust. Show thyself.

This chapter will take me through
	1. primitive type like ints, strings, floats etc
	2. functions and methods (wow methods :-))
	3. control flow (some functional goodness tooo)
	4. complex types like structs, enums, generics type things.
	5. collections like array, vectors, tuples (just the kind of things i like to see.)
	6. rust's utilities.
	7. project tooling   ( crates and third party libraries. )

This sure will be a chapter to recon with. Like a december to remember. CORNY SHIT!
